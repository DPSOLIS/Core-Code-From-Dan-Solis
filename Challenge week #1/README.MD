## 2. Hot'N Cold
- Fahrenheit to Celsius Algorithm:
    - Subtract 32 from the Fahrenheit temperature.

    - Multiply the result by 5/9 to get the temperature in Celsius.
    The formula can be expressed as:
    C = (F - 32) * 5/9 Where C is the temperature in Celsius and F is the temperature in Fahrenheit.

- Celsius to Fahrenheit Algorithm:
    - Multiply the Celsius temperature by 9/5.

    - Add 32 to the result to get the temperature in Fahrenheit. The formula can be expressed as:
    
        F = (C * 9/5) + 32

        Where F is the temperature in Fahrenheit and C is the temperature in Celsius.
